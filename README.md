## tl;dr
Grabs the current (WordPress) blog's post title and URL and puts them in a Tweet box.

## About
This mostly replicates WordPress's missing auto sharing functionality which
disappeared <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/04/29/why-twitter-auto-sharing-is-coming-to-an-end/">after the owner of Twitter dramatically increased API prices</a>.

Tested in Safari 16.4 for macOS.  Probably works in other browsers, but I haven't tested.

## Getting Started

1. Copy and paste tweetblogpost.js code above to new bookmarklet
2. Go to the latest post in your blog, for example https://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM/####/##/##/TITLE/
3. Click the bookmarklet in your browser

### Prerequisites

A browser with JavaScript enabled, and a blog.  Only tested with WordPress.

## Known Bugs

- [ ] None at this time

## Potential Improvements

- [ ] more flexible title extraction that supports more than just WordPress.  (you can modify this
  by updating h1.entry-title (on line 3) for your blog)
